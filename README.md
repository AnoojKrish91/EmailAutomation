# EmailAutomation
This application was built to automate sending status reports to team members and leads of my project on the work done every week. I used to forget sending the emails every week. So I went ahead and did a Spring boot CRON job.

Steps for you:

  1. Change credentials in src/main/application.properties file and try the application.
